# weather-pattern-forecasting
This MATLAB project performs time series forecasting on weather data from the GHCN dataset. The dataset includes daily temperature and precipitation readings. The project preprocesses data, applies a moving average model for temperature prediction, visualizes the results, and evaluates model performance using metrics like MSE.
